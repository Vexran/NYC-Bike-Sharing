# NYC-Bike-Sharing
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau
## Overview
The framework for this project is data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bike-share program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
1. Who uses this program?
2. What area of a city is seen the most through bike-share usage
3. What time of day are bikes used the most and least
4. How much are bikes used and by whom?
## Results
While the demographics of Des Moines differ from the makeup of the citizenry of NYC, an overlook of CitiBike riders shines a light on who bike-share might appeal to, regardless of locale.

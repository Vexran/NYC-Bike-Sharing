# NYC-Bike-Sharing
An analysis of NYC CitiBike bikesharing data from August, 2019, with Tableau
## Overview
The framework for this project is data from CitiBike in New York City for presentation to investors looking to begin a bike-share program in Des Moines, Iowa. While Des Moines is a long way away from the hustle and bustle of NYC, this analysis might help answer a few key questions:
1. Who uses this program?
2. What area of a city is seen the most through bike-share usage
3. What time of day are bikes used the most and least
4. How much are bikes used and by whom?
## Results
While the demographics of Des Moines differ from the makeup of the citizenry of NYC, an overlook of CitiBike riders shines a light on who bike-share might appeal to, regardless of locale.

In the above image, we can see that more than 3/4 of the users are Subscribers who make regular use of the bikes and are a great source of income for the program. Bikeshare program users are also predominantly male, at approximately 5/8 to only about 1/4 female. The remaining 1/8 gender is unknown or undeclared.

The above map displays the bike stations from which recorded bike trips started. The circles' size and the green's darkness indicate the relative number of trips started at those locations. Most bike trips originate in the bustling commercial heart of Lower Manhattan, known for towering office buildings, densely packed residential skyscrapers, and entertainment venues. Consequently, bike usage is lower in the less densely packed surrounding neighborhoods.
